_About Bank testing_

Banking applications are one of the most complex applications in today’s software development and testing industry. This problem has been solved relatively recently, due to the fact that the systems of banks have existed for many years, they already have well-established orders regarding the maintenance of accounts and transactions, but in step with the development of evaluation, applications and sites for each bank were invented to make it easier for their customers to monitor their accounts and banking activities. My project solves the problem of bureaucracy in banks by using the digital version of account management, so customers can always see their spending history.
For my project, I used covered main need for bank testing sites, such as:

•	Registration, to make sure every user has his own account to enter.

•	Autharization to preserve confidentiality and integrity of information in the system: To protect user accounts and their personal data (only the account owner can access the account upon successful authorization).

Web site which made for bank to make clients ability to control transactions.

Project contains both backend and frontend, there is registration and autharization.
