_About Bank testing_

Banking applications are one of the most complex applications in today’s software development and testing industry.
For my project, I used covered main need for bank testing sites, such as:

•	Registration, to make sure every user has his own account to enter.

•	Autharization to preserve confidentiality and integrity of information in the system: To protect user accounts and their personal data (only the account owner can access the account upon successful authorization).

Web site which made for bank to make clients ability to control transactions.

Project contains both backend and frontend, there is registration and autharization.
